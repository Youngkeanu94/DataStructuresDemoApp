This C# program demonstrates the use of various data structures for storing and manipulating data. It includes an array of structures for car details, a dictionary for inventory counts, an ArrayList for days of the week, a stack, and a queue. The program executes several tasks: listing car details, showing inventory counts, iterating through days, modifying work days, demonstrating stack operations (push, peek), and queue operations (enqueue, dequeue). This illustrates basic data structure manipulations and is useful for understanding how different structures are used in programming.
